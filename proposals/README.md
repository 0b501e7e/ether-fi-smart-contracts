# ether.fi Improvement Proposal (EFIP)


## Summary

An EFIP serves as a document which informs the ether.fi community about new features or changes to ether.fiâ€™s smart contract or processes. It should deliver a clear specification and the rationale behind the changes. 


## Motivation

EFIPs are intended to enhance transparency regarding the features and future upgrades that ether.fi is planning. In addition, we envision EFIPs as the main method for suggesting new features, gathering inputs from the community on various issues, and discussing the design choices that shape Ether.Fi. EFIPs will also serve a historical archive of feature proposals by tracking their initiative, revision, and delivery.

For ether.fi contributors, EFIPs offer a structured way to monitor the progress of their work. Each implementation maintainer is encouraged to list the EFIPs they have implemented, offering end users a straightforward method to track the status of specific implementations or libraries.



## EFIP Format

EFIPs should be written in markdown format. Plz, check the template [link](./efip-template.md)
